      Long time moka pot user sets record!<br>

        Long time coffee drinker and moka pot user Raitis Veinbahs (pictured below) has burned yet another moka pot!
        The incident transpired on September 1st in the sunny seaside town of JÅ«rmala,
        where the moka pot in question was resting happily on a gas stove,
        unaware that it is once again going to be absolutely god damn burned for the 1000th time by its rightful,
        but very forgetful owner!
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the press has not been able to receive access to footage of the incident,
        despite repeatedly trying to persuade the owner to release the footage, knowing full well,
        this mouth-breather must have a camera in someplace or another, as this by now is almost a daily recurrence.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the interview with the press, the owner of the moka pot laughed, saying stuff like "I should have known better"
        and "I really don't care how it tastes in the end, I just drink it",
        although later showed regret, claiming "this isn't very adultlike" and frankly saying he feels "stupid",
        after unsuccessfully trying to force the spoiled, smelly drink onto the news crew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though such accidents are entirely avoidable and just require basic precautions to prevent them from happening again,
        there is little hope the steps to mitigate the problem will ever be taken.
        In response to our inquiry in regards to the incident, the head of the local fire department said:
        "Incidents of this kind are not out of the ordinary and usually result in little harm,
        however this rabid specimen really is special and he should have really learned how to operate fire a long time ago."
      </p>

      <p>
        Researcher at the University of Latvia has stated that such coffee preparation techniques resemble those of a medieval alchemist with dementia
        and has called upon his friends and family to protest the sale of moka pots and in hopes to avoid "bad coffee" in the neighborhood and urged
        others to do the same.
